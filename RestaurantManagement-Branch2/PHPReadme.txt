The menu and event management system are run using PHP code and store items in a PHPmyadmin database. These features require XAMPP to be installed for the webpages to load restaraunt data such as menu items and for viewing, adding, and removing events and restaurant items. 

Xampp can be downloaded from this link. https://www.apachefriends.org/
Xampp should be installed prior to the downloading of the exe file package so that the code can be placed in the directory
C:\xampp\htdocs\dashboard\<AdvancedSoftwareDevelopment>

Once Xampp is installed, the program must be lanuched and Apache and MYSQL must be run. The 'database.sql' file must then be imported into PHPMyadmin. PHPMyadmin can be found under localhost/phpmyadmin. The user may then view and perform CRUD operastions for menu management and event management once the files are saved into the above location. The menu features can be accessed via the home page.
